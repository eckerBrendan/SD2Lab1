This is the first project from Software Development 2
Where you give a .wav file without the extension.
Then gives you 3 options to do.
- Option 1 - Takes the wav file and reversed the sound.
- Option 2 - Takes a filename to save a new wav file with a frequency that is entered in by the user. 
- Option 3 - Was for extra credit and is not implented.
